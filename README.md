**Dataset Overview**
There are two datasets provided for this analysis. The Train Dataset contains 709 records and is used to train a machine learning model to predict an individual's personality type based on various psychological traits and demographic features. The Test Dataset contains 315 records and is used to evaluate the trained model's performance on previously unseen data, ensuring its ability to generalize well to new inputs. Both datasets are structured and include a mix of numerical and categorical variables, making them suitable for classification tasks in personality prediction.
